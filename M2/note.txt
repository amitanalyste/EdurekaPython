a       - Open file for appending
ab      - Open file for appending in binary
a+      - Open file for reading and appending
ab+     - Open file for reading and appending in binary

Sequence are containers with items that are accessible by indexing or slicing. len() function takes any container as an argumment and returns the number of items in the container
Sequence Operation:
1. Concatenation
2. Repetition
3. Membership testing
4. Slicing
